Hi there !
I hope that going through my assessment wasn't terribly exhausting! I've lacked the energy to clean and comment as much as the previous one. I've registered the amount of hours that I've worked on this assessment and the final number will be close to 14 hours. That's รง probably twice as much as the previous assessment.

The thing is that I was really nervous Tuesday before the briefing because I did not feel prepared. When I learned that we were going to use the same template that relaxed me a bit and then when I actually went through the document I realized that almost everything was in the solution to the practice assessment.

So I've relayed A LOT in that solution (that's probably really obvious), and although I understand everything I've copied, I realize I lack the fluency I had for the previous assessment. Only for the last features I've felt like I had a firm grasp over the project.

There are a couple of weird things you might find:

-For feature 3: The number of hearts an artwork has is also updated in the list of artworks on `/`
I understood at first that the redux state for artworks should also update without refreshing so I had to mess around with that a lot and It's messy.
-Also Feature 3: The way I calculate and check the valid minimum bet i's not clean at all neither in the front end nor in the backend.
The default value of the input does not update and I do not know why.
